Hi, welcome to my blog, where I expose my rage.

First thing first, let's break the ice introducing myself. I'm an engineer and a writer wannanbe.
Being an software engineer, a profession that most of the time dealing with problems aren't mine. 
Seriously, you either become an entrepreneur or end up being the slave.

I know, right? ... But back to point, the reason why I create this blog.

## I want to write.

I can feel the urge to write down something that clicks people. I want to do it. And I
doing it right now. It is the only reason why I'm combining my limited vocabularies 
to create something barely works.

## I want to record my mind

I think everyone is a philosopher to some extent. Some are in depression realizing
this life is meaningless, while others are taking first steps on the path becoming the next Nietzsche.

> "Me? Oh, I'm just a regular type dude ... with a big-ass dick"

Personally, as my journey goes along, I need somewhere to set milestones. Let's just hope I won't
go insane proving my sanity.       

Welcome to my blog.
