Hi, welcome to my blog, where I expose my rage.

First thing first, let's break the ice introducing myself. My name is T... Oh, I'm gonna stop you
right there. It's better we talk in the dark, or else our ugly prejudgement gonna ruin it. Also, who am I doesn't really
matter much cause I personally don't seek popularity. So, just call me T. I'm an engineer and a writer wannabe.
Being an software engineer, a profession that most of the time dealing with problems aren't mine, I often get tired and wander around
doing nonsense things. This is one of those times.
I'm tired of being part of the system, a cog in a giant machine. Seriously, you either become an entrepreneur or end up being the slave.
It hurts accepting the bare truth. So here I am, writing this bullshit just to calm myself down for awhile.

I know, right? ... But back to point, the reason why I create this blog.

## I want to write.

I can feel the urge to write down something that clicks people. I want to do it. And I
doing it right now. It is the only reason why I'm combining my limited vocabularies
to create something barely works.

## I want to record my mind

I think everyone is a philosopher to some extent. Some are in depression realizing
this life is meaningless, while others are taking first steps on the path becoming the next Nietzsche.

> "Me? Oh, I'm just a regular type dude ... with a big-ass dick"

Personally, as my journey goes along, I need somewhere to set milestones. Let's just hope I won't
go insane proving my sanity.       

Welcome to my blog.
