      <title>6 months a sailor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I&amp;rsquo;m not publishing anything. My small little blog seems a little dusty I feel sticky
typing this new post. The past 6 months was wild, filled with events shall never fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my thesis project and succesfully defended it against a board. A+ was a fair trade for the hardship I&amp;rsquo;d been
enduring for half a year. My graduation thesis was about Digital Signal Processing, a territory I&amp;rsquo;d never set foot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was uncomfortable since even with the sincere guidance from Mr. Nhut, my thesis instructor, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a
gasp of what to do. The Fourier series and all kind of transforms did their best morphing me into a DSP research student,
but all failed. That was when I know this academic journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me and I needed a different approach. It&amp;rsquo;s not
sticks and stones that can win this thesis battle, especially this engineering project. I needed brute force. Guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesis boat had sailed but stranded. The worried instructor helplessly turned to me, his first research student,
and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re getting overpowered. You should swim back to land. I&amp;rsquo;ll defend those academica monsters for ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your Fourier cannons won&amp;rsquo;t last long, you could di&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suddenly grabbed my shoulder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me son, it&amp;rsquo;s my fault bringing you on this wrong fight. But you deserve another chance to battle the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now leave!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I swam back the the land, where I could be calm and thinking clearly. Actually, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think a bit. I went straight
into coding mode, applying my programming kungfu to illustrate the way Fourier transforms work. After 1 week, I came back
the ship with a Golang AK47 rifle that left the captain in awe.
With this awesome firepower, the project was basically done. A good understanding
of audio and the methods to manipulate it is crucial. It gave me the confidence and intuition to read papers and
implement them. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I slain the thesis with my rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wrong. In research field, it&amp;rsquo;s not experimenting but writing that drives you crazy. I spent 1 month completing
the project, and 5 months to present it in a scientific way. And a rifle was not the right weapon, again. I needed
something subtle but lethal when executed right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain shouted out loud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prirates are coming! Prepare to melee combat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your magic won&amp;rsquo;t work now, son. You better go back, I&amp;rsquo;ll fight them for ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me look for more Go packages. I can stil&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brave heart slapped me in the face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me nerd! There&amp;rsquo;s no open source copy-paste that can save you now. But you have to be alive to save us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back and apprenticed a blacksmith undercover swordmaster. He tought me the art of sword fighting and gave the
legendary sword LaTex to fight the pirates. So again, I rushed back to the fleeing ship to rescue my beloved captain and
crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was mayhem. I used LaTex to write my little thesis, it&amp;rsquo;s
an okay choice. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have beautiful format, professional looking document, but who cares, really. After
scrapping the brain for ideas, how to present them, I had to go deeper in hell writing LaTex in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;SublimeText&lt;/a&gt;. And guess what,
when a syntax or semantic error pops up, only God knows where it crashes your document. Lesson learnt. Only trust LaTex
when time is out of the equation, otherwise Google Docs is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough times never last, only tough people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing is printing, ofcourse. Every details had to be the same as it is required. A word of advice, prepare the
layout and format of the cover as many printing firms don&amp;rsquo;t have a ready template. I recommend the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inlamson.com.vn/&#34;&gt;Lam Son&lt;/a&gt; photocopy and printing shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day of rekoning, when I had to defend against a group of elite professors and doctors. I was all in for the
technical aspect of my project. By that, I pushed the demo project to the internet, even the slides are made in a very
geeky way. The objective was to showcase the strength of engineering, though until now I doubt any member of the board
realized that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the demo, I chose the popular song at that point &lt;code&gt;We don&#39;t talk anymore&lt;/code&gt; to perform audio watermarking. It was a
reckless move I rekon. But fortunately it yielded warming results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6 months doing research, I can firmly say that, I&amp;rsquo;d never do this again, ever. To be fair, it was a nice to have
and one time only experience, expecially when I&amp;rsquo;m at the gate of adulthood. The returned attributes are invaluable for
whom intend to apply for post grad school. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Mr. Minh-Nhut Ngo, my instructor, for this wonderful tryout in the DSP field. It gave me nightmares
sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to express gratitude towards the boards, whose kind but precise comments had enhanced my thesis significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, I&amp;rsquo;d like to stop here to go out with my family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The acid-free letter</title>
      <link>http://tintrongnguyen.me/posts/20160615/letters/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 23:16:29 +0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Education, my lady&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprising to realize that we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other for a really long time, yet this is the first time we talk, like really? Our first met was so humble that I hardly recognize you from the images.
You was so complicated yet so beautiful. The way you could instantly tell whether
a number is prime was so attractive that guys keep giving
you arbitrary numbers just to hear your voice. I was in love, blindly. As time passes, I tried so
hard to befriend with you. Make friend with the librarian, apprentice the most evil profs, kill the last light, I&amp;rsquo;ve done it all.
Fortunately, it was okay, for a while. Until one day, your complexity hit me like a train. I knew that train would
come one day, but damn &amp;hellip; that algorithm.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/dFGKLIk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;leo&#34; /&gt;
You changed so fast I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even look you in the eyes, your beautiful
eyes. Even thinking about you horrified me, I was suffocated as your big Os slowly appearing in my mind. Seeing you hanging
out with other guys amplified the pain inside even more. Soon, my endurance maxed out and I dropped. You were my first, one-sided love,
yet I cowardly turned tail and ran. How miserable is that? I let the gods decide. Today, I am writing this not to pledge empathy but to seek redemption for my own mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I dwell in the past or something, but this is a good occasion for me to do this.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/oX5RRGN.gif&#34; alt=&#34;hart&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As time passes, I entered university to be even more miserable. Like wtf? We went to the same school, again. I was drowning in
the battles inside my own head. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt your parents feelings as they asked me to take care of you, but on the other hand I would have to lie to myself doing so because frankly, I disgust you to my core. I thought you would become mature with uni, but no, somehow you leave your beauty back in highschool, you changed. At uni, you turn yourself into a joke, and I got news for you, it was not funny. The way I saw it, you and your friends was a big-ass joke walking around in the uni, while everyone else pretend to attentively listen and laugh. &amp;ldquo;Ha ha ha&amp;rdquo;. You guys made me sick. Ironically, doctors aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to make me sick, but your friends did. The worst part is I was trapped in this rat race. In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t notice, your parents gave me money, a lot of money, just to look after you. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give up, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing. Couple months passed, I stopped whining and accepted the rules. I lied to myself playing your parents game, while try my best govern the rage inside. What&amp;rsquo;s worse than 2 faces liar? I let the gods decide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am sorry for putting all over you like this, I truly am. I know now, it is not entirely because of you that I become so toxic towards love matters. I&amp;rsquo;ve been single for 3 years, and it just recently that I open myself more than often. I&amp;rsquo;d met this girl, her name is W. Right now, dating with her make me feel good about myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. More importantly, I know now that your parents is the reason why we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be together, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely your fault. But I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them too, parents always wish the best for their child, right? Okay, the letter&amp;rsquo;s getting long now, I better pause and reserve the good stuff for later. This is my first letter for you, there would be more, when the time comes. I am looking forward to your reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best regards,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P/s: How&amp;rsquo;s you parents doing? Is Mr. Government still lives alone? Send my regards for your parents,okay? You should take better care of them, I heard there&amp;rsquo;s a virus called democracy going around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why I created this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-want-to-write&#34;&gt;I want to write.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the urge to write down something that clicks people. I want to do it. And I
doing it right now. It is one of the main reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m combining my limited vocabularies
to create something barely works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/TwRKVsd.gif&#34; alt=&#34;joker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is about eliminating poor choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-want-to-record-my-mind&#34;&gt;I want to record my mind.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things happend in a day and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to recall everything. So it&amp;rsquo;s better to have a place where
you can filter the good stuff and write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create stories, we need materials. It&amp;rsquo;s in everyday life if we know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-of-having-something-your-own-is-liberating&#34;&gt;The idea of having something your own is liberating.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Tin, a software engineer based in Saigon, Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love building software and products in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m bored, reading and writing are my options to escape reality. Like computers, right? I/O operations are the most common activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently work at &lt;a href=&#34;http://floatingcube.com&#34;&gt;Floating Cube Studios&lt;/a&gt;, also based in Saigon. We develop point of sale products and packages for small to middle size clients in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t call myself a writer, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to fit in the writing habit.
There&amp;rsquo;s something about crafting sentences that lures me into creating this blog and start putting my thoughts online.
I personally think the choice of words is art.
Strangely, I can&amp;rsquo;t write in my mother tongue, yet, the feeling of cringing keeps striking me.
It&amp;rsquo;s something I definitely should work on, as this practice of literacy possibly be my main activity in the next 10 years.
And writing in English is not a good approach for a non-native speaker, in a country that doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak the language.
At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the freedom of burden and write whatever I want.
But in the long run, screenwriting is what I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a writer of any kind and located in Saigon, drop me a buzz and I buy you a drink! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
